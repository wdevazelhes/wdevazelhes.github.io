<h3>Education</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>2021 to 2024 (expected).</strong> <em>PhD Candidate</em>,  <em>MBZUAI</em>, UAE <em>ML</em><br>
    I am currently working on optimization for machine learning (zeroth-order optimization and sparsity, in particular hard-thresholding algorithms).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>2012 to 2016.</strong> <em>Master of Science</em>, <em>Supelec</em>, France <em>SIR major (Machine Learning and Signal Processing)</em><br>
    Machine Learning, Numerical Optimization, Image and Speech Processing, Statistics and Probabilities, High Performance Computing, Software Engineering, Electrical Engineering.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Jan. 2014 to June 2014.</strong> <em>ERASMUS Programme</em>, <em>Universidad Carlos III</em>, Madrid, Spain<br>
    Medical Image Processing, Multimodality Imaging, Telecommunications, Communication Theory.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>2010 to 2012.</strong> <em>Preparatory School</em>, <em>Stanislas</em>, Paris, France<br>
    Preparation in Mathematics and Physics for the French Engineering Schools competition. Algebra, Bases of Topology and Set Theory, Linear Algebra, Real Analysis, Multivariate Analysis, Differential Equations, Physics.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Experience (5y+)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Dec. 2019 to April 2021.</strong> <em>Research Student</em>,    <em>Huawei & Universite Gustave Eiffel</em>, Paris, France<br>
    I worked on the links between Information Theory and Machine Learning, as well as Optimal Transport.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sept. 2017 to Aug. 2019.</strong>    <em>Research Engineer</em>, <em>Inria</em>, Magnet Team, Lille, France<br>
    I worked on a scikit-learn compatible package for metric learning, under the supervision of Aurelien Bellet. (1K+, 50+ cit.) I improved pre-existing algorithms performance, for instance by vectorizing computations in novel ways, changing the iterative methods for optimizing the algorithms, solving problems due to numerical uncertainties, or check-proofing the algorithms by testing them on mathematical toy problems. I have commited a few contributions to scikit-learn, including a new algorithm: Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA). I also worked part time with members of the MAGNET team on a research project using sparse PCA for word embeddings (equivalent of a master's research project). The idea was that standard PCA is statistically inconsistent in high dimensions (like that of co-occurence matrices), but not sparse PCA.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Oct. 2016 to July 2017.</strong> <em>Data Scientist</em>,    <em>Sidetrade</em>, Boulogne-Billancourt, France<br>
    I improved and interpreted several algorithms previously prototyped, including a relational linkage algorithm (RLA), using elasticsearch and scikit-learn. I also designed and analyzed mail classification algorithms (using for instance Naive Bayes, SVC, Logistic Regression, Feature Selection...).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Apr. 2016 to Sept. 2016.</strong>  <em>Research Intern</em>,    <em>Orange Labs</em>, Chatillon, France<br>
    I worked on Deep Reinforcement Learning for Human-Machine Dialogue, under the supervision of Romain Laroche. I implemented several algorithms to maximize the score when playing against a human in a negotiation game, and analyzed the policy, value, and score evolution along the training, to find ways to improve them, on this particular problem.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Jan. 2015 to July 2015.</strong> <em>Research Intern</em>, <em>Polytechnique Montreal</em>, Montreal, Canada<br>
    I computed and implemented a MAP criterion (and its gradient) from a statistical model of tomographic projections, for reconstructing a 3D image in Computed Tomography, and optimized it with a conjugate gradient method (l-bfgs-b). I analyzed the conditions of convergence of this criterion (initial conditions, different parameters).
  </li>
